About the input files:

1) MuSEDraw_fromPAul_Reimer_2Sept2018.g4bl is the file I received from Paul Reimer on Sept 2, 2018.

2) MuSEDraw.g4bl file is an update of the MuSEDraw_fromPAul_Reimer_2Sept2018.g4bl file with the following 
   corrections:
   
  a) LQSL = 600 mm (to match Turtle old input)
  b) Grad of magnetic fields corrected: should be gradient wrt radius and not length
  c) QSL15 (B) gradient was not defined in the previous version. I added that. 
  
3) MuSEDraw_new_changes_3Oct2018_adopted_turtle_values.g4bl is an update of the MuSEDraw.g4bl file. In this,
   I changed the beam line element positions so that they matched the current position values 
   (referred to as 'adopted' values by Ron Gilman) used in Turtle. 
   
4) VERY IMPORTANT: Not included in the 'input_files' folder are the fieldmaps for the dipole magnets, 
because the file sizes are bigger than 25 MB. Please take these file (ASM1.g4blmap and ASM2.g4blmap) from Paul Reimer.

5) Folder 'Turtle_ASCII_Gems_at_IFP_NovtoJan2019': The name is self-explanatory. Further 
details below:

   a) The folder 'GEM@IFP' contains input files with GEMs placed at the IFP,
   to match the experimental conditions during the summer 2018 beam time.
