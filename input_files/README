PRoy (4 Oct 2018):

About the input files:

1) MuSEDraw_fromPAul_Reimer_2Sept2018.g4bl is the file I received from Paul Reimer on Sept 2, 2018.

2) MuSEDraw.g4bl file is an update of the MuSEDraw_fromPAul_Reimer_2Sept2018.g4bl file with the following 
   corrections:
   
  a) LQSL = 600 mm (to match Turtle old input)
  b) Grad of magnetic fields corrected: should be gradient wrt radius and not length
  c) QSL15 (B) gradient was not defined in the previous version. I added that. 
  
3) MuSEDraw_new_changes_3Oct2018_adopted_turtle_values.g4bl is an update of the MuSEDraw.g4bl file. In this,
   I have changed the beam line element positions so that they match the current position values 
   (referred to as 'adopted' values by Ron Gilman) used in Turtle. 
   
4) Not included in the 'input_files' folder is a fieldmap file for the dipole magnets, because the file size 
   is bigger than 25 MB. Please take this file (ASM.g4blmap) from Paul Reimer or Priyashree Roy.
