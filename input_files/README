About the input files:

1) MuSEDraw_fromPAul_Reimer_2Sept2018.g4bl is the file I received from Paul Reimer on Sept 2, 2018.

2) MuSEDraw.g4bl file is an update of the MuSEDraw_fromPAul_Reimer_2Sept2018.g4bl file with the following 
   corrections:
   
  a) LQSL = 600 mm (to match Turtle old input)
  b) Grad of magnetic fields corrected: should be gradient wrt radius and not length
  c) QSL15 (B) gradient was not defined in the previous version. I added that. 
  
3) MuSEDraw_new_changes_3Oct2018_adopted_turtle_values.g4bl is an update of the MuSEDraw.g4bl file. In this,
   I changed the beam line element positions so that they matched the current position values 
   (referred to as 'adopted' values by Ron Gilman) used in Turtle. 
   
4) VERY IMPORTANT: Not included in the 'input_files' folder are the fieldmaps for the dipole magnets, 
because the file sizes are bigger than 25 MB. Please take these file (ASM1.g4blmap and ASM2.g4blmap) from Paul Reimer.

5) Folder 'Turtle_ASCII_Gems_at_IFP_NovtoJan2019': The name is self-explanatory. Further 
details below:

   a) The folder 'GEM@IFP' contains input files with GEMs placed at the IFP, as well as collimators and slits,
   to match the experimental conditions during the summer 2018 beam time. These input files were created 
   between Nov 2018 to Jan 2019. 'MuSE_v5.4.1_QTA_QTBdefaultB_28Jan2019.g4bl' is the
   latest input file and uses a mu extended source as the input source (the input
   textfile is the 'g4_in.txt' textfile located in the same folder. The code 'textfile.cc' was used to 
   convert the mu extended source distribution generated by Ron G. (FOR070_big.DAT) into a format compatible with 
   g4beamline).
   
      i) The folder 'point_source' within 'GEM@IFP' contains the same kind of
      input files as described above, the only difference being that the input files
      use a point pion source as the input source. 

6) Folder 'Jan2019_muon_source_input': The name is self explanatory to some extent. Further details below:
    a) muon extended source was used. Source file was generated by Ron G. on 26 Jan 2019 (allmuonraysv6.DAT). Decays OFF.
    b) I ran with +/-8 cm amd +/-1.1 cm FS11, combined with 0.5 cm and 10.5 cm collimator opening, and compared
    with Turtle simulation. The input files for the g4beamline simulation, 'MuSE_v5.6_noDecay_11mmFS11_5mmColl.g4bl', 
    'MuSE_v5.6_noDecay_11mmFS11_105mmColl.g4bl' etc, correspond to the different run conditions. 
    
7) Folder 'Jan2019_pion_source_input': The name is self explanatory to some extent. Further details below:
    a) Pion point source was used. Source file was generated by Ron G. on 26 Jan 2019 (FOR070_pions.DAT). 
    b) The input file for g4beamline simulation is 'MuSE_v5.5_ASCII_GEMatIFP_noDecay.g4bl'. There is no GEM at the IFP,
    contrary to what the name suggests.
