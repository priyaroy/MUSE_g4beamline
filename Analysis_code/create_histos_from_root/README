This directory contains the code to read the output rootfile 
containing ntuples from g4beamline simulation and 
create histograms, canvases etc. The code "analysis.cc" is 
the main code which calls other subroutines to perform various 
jobs with the ultimate goal of creating histograms.

To compile: $cd <code_dir>
            $make clean; make 
            
To execute: $./analysis1
