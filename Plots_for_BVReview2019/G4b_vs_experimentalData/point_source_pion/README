The plots show a qualitative comparison of spatial and angle distributions of pions at the Intermediate focal point (IFP) of the beamline, and at the target region. Pion beam energy is 155 MEV. 

The blue lines show G4beamline simulation predictions.

The red points are from experimental data. 

Conclusion: there is a fairly good qualitative agreement between the simulation and the experimental data. To improve it further, we need realistic modeling of the dipole magnets.
