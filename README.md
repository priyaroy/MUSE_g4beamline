# MUSE_g4beamline
PiM1 beamline simulation based on Geant4 (g4beamline software).
This repository shows my work on g4beamline simulation software to compare its predictions of the position-velocity distributions of beam particles with another optics-based simulation called Turtle, and with the experimental data. Additionally, I developed a C++ software package to analyze the results of the g4beamline simulation using the Root-cern visualization tool.
